# Final Project: SVD README
`Driver_LinAl.f90`:
Purpose: A driver file that uses the library LAPACK to run a SVD decomposition on a data file.
Run Command: Type 'make' to command window to create executable 'LinAl.exe'. Type './LinAl.exe' to run executable.

`plotter.py`:
Purpose: Plots the SVD decomposition of 'dog_bw_data.dat' as well as the resulting errors for sigma_k = [10,20,40,80,160,320,640,1279]
Run Command: Type 'python3 plotter.py' to command window, see 'SVDDecomp.jpg' and 'SVDError.jpg' for the resulting images
